# Hello_World
My first repository

At the moment, I am studying information systems engineering. it's more electronics, microcontrollers .. I like it, but I doubt if I would like to do this in the near future. In high school, I like to create very simple HTML, CSS, PHP based web sites. Therefore, I would like to test myself as a software developer.
